## Project Structure

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following components:

### 1. Problem Explanation
- Description of the dataset and classification task
- Definition of objectives and evaluation criteria

### 2. Model Development
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Training and testing schemes
- Implementation of multiple classification models studied in class

### 3. Model Evaluation and Comparison
For each classifier:
- Performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, AUC, ROC curve, confusion matrix)
- Confidence intervals for evaluation metrics
- Statistical comparison between models
- Analysis of strengths and weaknesses
- Selection of the best model with proper justification

### 4. Results and Discussion
- Detailed discussion of model behavior
- Class-wise performance analysis
- Feature relevance and model limitations
- Potential improvements and failure cases

### 5. Final Reflection
- Lessons learned throughout the course
- Personal evaluation of the course content
- Insights gained about artificial intelligence
